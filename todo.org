* TODO Find a universal API fuzzy finder and explorer

* Find a way to fuzzy search the AWS API

* List all API endpoints
[[egr:aws api list all endpoints]]
[[egr:github api list all endpoints]]
[[egr:gitlab api list all endpoints]]
[[egr:terraform api list all endpoints]]
[[egr:docker api list all endpoints]]

** Fuzzy search endpoits
I need custom fuzzy finders.
I've been working on that in emacs, which is good.

* TODO Automate the aws cli a bit more
- filter-cmd-buttonize
- =aws-instances=

* Set up tools
** Set up =aws-shell=
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/super-charge-your-aws-command-line-experience-with-aws-shell/

** Set up =saws=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  x -sh saws -z "saws>" -s "aws " -i
#+END_SRC

** =aws-fuzzy-finder=
https://github.com/pmazurek/aws-fuzzy-finder

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  py -36 i aws-fuzzy-finder
#+END_SRC

This is just for finding instances and sshing into them.

But it would be more useful to automate/extend emacs' =aws-instances=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  mkw aws-fuzzy
#+END_SRC
