As soon as I write =emp=, awk creates it. No need to declare it.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code :inb data1
  awk '{ printf("%s made %.2f dollars\n", $1, $2*$3) }'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src bash
Beth made 0.00 dollars
Dan made 0.00 dollars
Kathy made 40.00 dollars
Mark made 100.00 dollars
Mary made 121.00 dollars
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_SRC bash -n :i bash :async :results verbatim code :inb data1
  awk '$2 * $3 > 50 { printf("%s made %.2f dollars\n", $1, $2*$3) }'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src bash
Mark made 100.00 dollars
Mary made 121.00 dollars
#+end_src
