Amazon Elastic File System
EFS
    A cloud storage service provided by Amazon
    Web Services designed to provide scalable,
    elastic, concurrent with some
    restrictions, and encrypted file storage
    for use with both AWS cloud services and
    on-premises resources.

    This is used to mount EFS filesystems.

    Utilities for Amazon Elastic File System
    (EFS)

task definition
    Required to run Docker containers in
    Amazon ECS.

    A task definition contains a list of
    container definitions received by the
    Docker daemon to create a container
    instance.

Amazon Resource Name
ARN
    It's an ID.

Amazon Elastic Container Service
ECS
    A cloud computing service in AWS that
    manages containers and allows developers
    to run applications in the cloud without
    having to configure an environment for the
    code to run in.
    
    ECS supports Docker, an open source Linux
    container service.

ESC Service
    https://medium.com/boltops/gentle-introduction-to-how-aws-ecs-works-with-example-tutorial-cea3d27ce63d#:~:text=Service%20%E2%80%94%20Defines%20long%20running%20tasks,instance%20to%20an%20ECS%20Cluster.

    Defines long running tasks of the same
    Task Definition.
    
    This can be 1 running container or
    multiple running containers all using the
    same Task Definition.

ECS cluster
    An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical
    grouping of tasks or services.
    
    If you are running tasks or services that
    use the EC2 launch type, a cluster is also
    a grouping of container instances.
    
    If you are using capacity providers, a
    cluster is also a logical grouping of
    capacity providers.

ECS task
    A task is the instantiation of a task
    definition within a cluster.
    
    After you have created a task definition
    for your application within Amazon ECS,
    you can specify the number of tasks to run
    on your cluster.
    
    The Amazon ECS task scheduler is
    responsible for placing tasks within your
    cluster.
