provisioner
    Note: Provisioners should only be used as
    a last resort. For most common situations
    there are better alternatives. For more
    information, see the main Provisioners
    page.

provisioner "file"
    Used to copy files or directories from the
    machine executing Terraform to the newly
    created resource. The file provisioner
    supports ssh.

Terraform graph
    Contains nodes

nodes
    types:
    - Resource node
    - Provider configuration node
    - Resource meta-node

resource node
    Manages an entity of this provider (EC2,
    VPC, and so on, in the case of AWS).

provider configuration node
    Configures a provider (AWS, in our
    examples)

resource meta-node
    Doesnâ€™t really do anything special; it is
    used for convenience and makes a graph
    more pretty. It is applicable only if you
    specify a count parameter greater than
    one.
