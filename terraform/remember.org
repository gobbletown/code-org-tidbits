* =resource=
Resources are the most important element in
the Terraform language. Each resource block
describes one or more infrastructure objects,
such as virtual networks, compute instances,
or higher-level components such as DNS
records.

** Resource Blocks documents the syntax for declaring resources.

** Resource Behavior explains in more detail how Terraform handles
 resource declarations when applying a configuration.

** The Meta-Arguments section documents special arguments that can be
 used with every resource type, including depends_on, count,
 for_each, provider, and lifecycle.

** Provisioners documents configuring post-creation actions for a
 resource using the provisioner and connection blocks. Since
 provisioners are non-declarative and potentially unpredictable, we
 strongly recommend that you treat them as a last resort.
