* Example
$MYGIT/voluntarily/vly2/Dockerfile

#+BEGIN_SRC dockerfile -n :async :results verbatim code
  FROM node:12 as base
  RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
  WORKDIR /usr/src/app
  
  FROM base as production_build
  RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
  WORKDIR /usr/src/app
#+END_SRC

By default, the stages are not named, and you
refer to them by their integer number,
starting with 0 for the first FROM
instruction.

However, you can name your stages, by adding
an AS <NAME> to the FROM instruction.

This example improves the previous one by
naming the stages and using the name in the
COPY instruction.

This means that even if the instructions in
your Dockerfile are re-ordered later, the COPY
doesnâ€™t break.
