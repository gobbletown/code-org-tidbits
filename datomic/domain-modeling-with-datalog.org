Example: github.
New users.
There are 3 users here in our system.
3 ids means they are different things.
Each row is a =datum=.

| entity | attribute    | value      |
|--------+--------------+------------|
|     11 | =:user/name= | richhickey |
|     22 | =:user/name= | tonsky     |
|     33 | =:user/name= | pithyless  |

We use pattern-matching for querying (Datomic).

A pattern in this case will be a vector of 3
elements that represents the EAV structure in
our database.

Underscore means I don't care (wildcard).

=[11 _ _]=

Variables start with a question mark and some
name i.e. =?entity=.
