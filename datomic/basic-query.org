* Basic query
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  [:find ?name
   :where
   [11 :user/name ?name]]
#+END_SRC

- name is bound

Order doesn't matter.

=where= is a set of clauses.

Always return sets of tuples.

Datalog is declarative and logic oriented.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  [:find ?id
   :where
   [?id :user/name "tonsky"]]
#+END_SRC

This will find the id.
