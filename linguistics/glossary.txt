generativism

X-bar theory
    A theory of syntactic category formation.

    It embodies two independent claims: one,
    that phrases may contain intermediate
    constituents projected from a head X; and
    two, that this system of projected
    constituency may be common to more than
    one category.

    Noam Chomsky said something about it.

    Language is designed as a system of
    thought and not of a system of
    externalisation.

phonology
    A branch of linguistics that studies how
    languages or dialects systematically
    organize their sounds.

    The term also refers to the sound system
    of any particular language variety.

    At one time, the study of phonology only
    related to the study of the systems of
    phonemes in spoken languages.

Reflexive pronoun
    In general linguistics, a reflexive
    pronoun, sometimes simply called a
    reflexive, is an anaphoric pronoun that
    must be coreferential with another nominal
    within the same clause.

    In the English language specifically, a
    reflexive pronoun will end in ‑self or
    ‑selves, and refer to a previously named
    noun or pronoun.

indelible
    Making marks that cannot be removed.

    "indelible fingerprint"

impossible language
     The human mind, despite its almost
     infinite ingenuity, can't invent a
     language that doesn't share the
     fundamental properties of language
     itself.

    - the conditions of possibility of language.
    - the mystery of human communication
