** Critique
- Chomsky is brilliant, but I am puzzled by
his 'limited' definition of language. I would
extend its definition to all lifeforms and
anything that has thought, stores learned /
generated information, or communicates.

He thinks it's a shot in the dark.

He thinks human experimentation is required,
since only humans have language (his
conception of language, anyway).
