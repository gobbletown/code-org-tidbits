GPT-3

It's not a LM. It works just as well for
impossible languages as for actual languages.
It is therefore refuted, if indended as a LM,
by normal scientific criteria.
Independently of the refutation, the way it
works has no relation to language or cognition
generally.
Perhaps it's useful for some purpose, but it
seems to tell us nothing about language or
cognition generally.
