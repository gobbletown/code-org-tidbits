* case vs cond
cond and case are different things.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  (cond
    (< x 2) "x is less than 2"
    (< x 10) "x is less than 10"
    :else "x is greater than or equal to 10")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  (case x
    5 "x is 5"
    10 "x is 10"
    "x isn't 5 or 10")
#+END_SRC
