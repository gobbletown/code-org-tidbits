The =:plugins= section declares the Leiningen
plugins that should be used for this project.
Leiningen plugins typically add additional
functionality to Leiningen that can be used
during the build process.

In this case, we have included the lein-
environ plugin, which automatically generates
the =.lein-env= configuration file.
