Duct
    A highly modular framework for building
    server-side applications in Clojure using
    data-driven architecture.

    It is similar in scope to Arachne, and is
    based on Integrant.
    
    Duct builds applications around an
    immutable configuration that acts as a
    structural blueprint.
    
    The configuration can be manipulated and
    queried to produce sophisticated behavior.
