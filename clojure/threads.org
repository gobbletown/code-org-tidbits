** main thread
There are actually four threads in this
program. The three I have created explicitly
and the one that I get automatically when I
run a Clojure program (sometimes called the
'main' thread).

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  (println "Before creating threads") 
   
  (def thread1 (new Thread (fn [] (println "Thread 1")))) 
  (.start thread1) 
   
  (def thread2 (new Thread (fn [] (println "Thread 2")))) 
  (.start thread2) 
   
  (def thread3 (new Thread (fn [] (println "Thread 3")))) 
  (.start thread3) 
   
  ;; This sleeps the main thread
  (Thread/sleep 500)
