This may be the most straightforward / concise way to do it, and it doesn't require building any sets (which is relatively expensive).

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  (keys (select-keys map-1 (keys map-2)))
#+END_SRC

Finally, an optimized version, which is a bit faster, and a bit harder to read:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n :i clj :async :results verbatim code
  (keep #(some->> % (find map-1) key) (keys map-2))
#+END_SRC
